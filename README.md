# TodoMVC demo backed by Datasette

This is a modified version of the [Vanilla JavaScript TodoMVC Example](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/vanillajs) adapted to demonstrate the [Datasette 1.0 alpha JSON API](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a0-2022-11-29).

To try this out:

- [Sign in as root](https://latest.datasette.io/login-as-root) to the Datasette demo instance
- Use the [Create API token](https://latest.datasette.io/-/create-token) page to create a new API token
- Visit https://simonw.github.io/todomvc-datasette/ and paste in your token

Database tables used by this demo are automatically deleted every 15 minutes.

The only code I changed from the original is the code in this file:
